# ## Ground Cricket Chirps
# 
# In _The Song of Insects_ (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures.  Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature.  Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.
# 
# In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60ยบ F. or warmer than 100ยบ F.

# ### Tasks
# 
# 1. Find the linear regression equation for this data.
# 2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
# 3. Find the equation's $R^2$ score (use the `.score` method) to determine whether the
# equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)
# 4. Extrapolate data:  If the ground temperature reached 95, then at what approximate rate would you expect the crickets to be chirping?
# 5. Interpolate data:  With a listening device, you discovered that on a particular morning the crickets were chirping at a rate of 18 chirps per second.  What was the approximate ground temperature that morning?

# ## Brain vs. Body Weight
# 
# In the file `brain_body.txt`, the average brain and body weight for a number of mammal species are recorded. Load this data into a Pandas data frame.
# 
# ### Tasks
# 
# 1. Find the linear regression equation for this data for brain weight to body weight.
# 2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
# 3. Find the equation's $R^2$ score (use the `.score` method) to determine whether the
# equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)

# ## Salary Discrimination
# 
# The file `salary.txt` contains data for 52 tenure-track professors at a small Midwestern college. This data was used in legal proceedings in the 1980s about discrimination against women in salary.
# 
# The data in the file, by column:
# 
# 1. Sex. 1 for female, 0 for male.
# 2. Rank. 1 for assistant professor, 2 for associate professor, 3 for full professor.
# 3. Year. Number of years in current rank.
# 4. Degree. Highest degree. 1 for doctorate, 0 for master's.
# 5. YSdeg. Years since highest degree was earned.
# 6. Salary. Salary/year in dollars.
# 
# ### Tasks
# 
# 1. Find the linear regression equation for this data using columns 1-5 to column 6.
# 2. Find the selection of columns with the best $R^2$ score.
# 3. Report whether sex is a factor in salary.
